# Skip Web app

## User Stories
A restaurant have clients that want listen to music during the lunch/dinner, the restaurant has an audio system, currently, the customers should write in a paper in order to do the playlist. The goal of this project is to eliminate the manual effort and making available an API to manage the playlist.

## Getting started

The web app will provide total management of the playlist, like, search available songs, add tracks in the list, check the playlist and remove the tracks already played.

The Web app uses the API skip-api in order to retrive data - https://github.com/guilhermemalfatti/skip-api

## Layout

For reasons of time, so far there are just two pages:

> /

That aims to search the tracks, so far there a fixed search by query "acdc"
