# Skip Web app

## User Stories
A restaurant have clients that want listen to music during the lunch/dinner, the restaurant has an audio system, currently, the customers should write in a paper in order to do the playlist. The goal of this project is to eliminate the manual effort and making available an API to manage the playlist.

## Getting started

The web app will provide total management of the playlist, like, search available songs, add tracks in the list, check the playlist and remove the tracks already played.

## Layout

For reasons of time, so far there are just two pages:

> /

That aims to search the tracks, so far there a fixed search by query "acdc"

> /playlist

That aims show the current playlist
